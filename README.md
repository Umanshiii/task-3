## 1. Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model for real estate pricing to assist buyers, sellers, and investors in estimating house prices based on specific parameters. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Model training and evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- User interaction for dynamic house price prediction.

---

## 2. Features
The following features are considered for prediction:
- Square Footage: Total area of the house in square feet.
- Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
- Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.

---

## 3. Dataset
A synthetic dataset has been used for demonstration purposes. Replace this with a real-world dataset for better accuracy and applicability.

---

## 4. Requirements
To run this project, you need the following tools and libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install the required libraries using:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## 5. How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd House-Price-Prediction
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```
4. Enter inputs for square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms when prompted to get a predicted price.

---

## 6. Results
- Model Evaluation:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): _e.g., 120,000_
  - R-Squared (R²): _e.g., 0.95_
- The scatter plot below shows the actual vs. predicted prices, demonstrating the model's accuracy.


---

## 7. Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional features such as location, age of the property, and proximity to amenities.
- Use advanced models like Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting Machines for better performance.
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
